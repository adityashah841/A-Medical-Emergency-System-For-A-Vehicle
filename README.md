The project is a medical emergency system designed for vehicles which aims to address situations where a driver becomes medically incapacitated while driving, ensuring the safety of both the driver and other road users. The system is composed of several components, including a push button (1), a camera (2), Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) technology (3), a siren (4), hazard lights (5), and a processing module (6).

When activated by the push button, the system takes control of the vehicle's pedal controls, preventing the driver from accelerating or braking. This action aims to avoid potential hazards caused by an incapacitated driver. The processing module is responsible for coordinating the various components of the system and processing data from sensors. It receives input from the camera and Lidar sensor to understand the vehicle's surroundings. The camera uses image recognition to track lane markings and ensure the vehicle stays in its lane, while the Lidar sensor creates a 3D map of the environment, helping the system maintain a safe distance from other objects.

The processing module also activates hazard lights, sounds a siren, and sends an SOS signal to nearby medical centers and police stations. This coordinated response alerts other drivers and pedestrians to the emergency and ensures timely assistance. The system's camera also detects and tracks lanes, allowing the vehicle to stay on the correct path, even if the driver is incapacitated. Additionally, the system adjusts the vehicle's speed and trajectory using data from the Lidar sensor to avoid collisions.

Once the vehicle reaches a safe speed, the system initiates a parking procedure using the Lidar sensor and camera information to identify an appropriate parking spot. After parking, the system unlocks the vehicle's doors, allowing emergency responders or bystanders to provide immediate assistance to the incapacitated driver.

Overall, this medical emergency system integrates camera and Lidar technologies to enable the vehicle to respond to driver incapacitation situations effectively. It takes control of the vehicle, maintains safe driving conditions, alerts emergency services, and facilitates parking in a safe location, with the ultimate goal of preventing accidents, minimizing risks, and ensuring prompt medical assistance.
