A‑Medical‑Emergency‑System‑For‑A‑Vehicle delivers a seamless, life‑saving response when a driver is medically incapacitated. By uniting a manual push‑button (1), high‑resolution camera (2), LiDAR sensor (3), siren (4), hazard lights (5), and an intelligent processing module (6), it safeguards both the driver and surrounding traffic.

**Immediate Control Override**  
On activation, the system instantly assumes throttle and brake control—preventing uncontrolled acceleration or abrupt stops.

**Real‑Time Environmental Awareness**  
Camera‑based lane detection and LiDAR‑powered 3D mapping provide precise lane keeping and obstacle avoidance, ensuring stable trajectory and speed.

**Coordinated Emergency Alerting**  
Hazard lights and siren engage simultaneously, while an SOS message (with GPS coordinates) is dispatched to nearby medical centers and law enforcement.

**Automated Safe Parking & Rescue**  
The processing module identifies a secure spot, autonomously parks the vehicle, then unlocks the doors to grant first responders immediate access.

This patented system integrates cutting‑edge sensors and control algorithms to minimize accident risk, accelerate medical intervention, and save lives on the road.
